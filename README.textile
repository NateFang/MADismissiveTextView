h1. MADismissiveTextView

MADismissiveTextView is a drop-in `UITextView` subclass that handles dismissing the keyboard with your finger, just like in the Messages.app.

h2. Usage

<code>MADismissiveTextView</code> is designed to be used in tandem with a <code>UIScrollView</code> as well as its <code>UIPanGestureRecognizer</code>. As such, *this class only works with iOS 5.0 and up*.

h3. Example

<pre>
UIScrollView *scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 44, 320, 416)];
[self.view addSubview:scrollView];

MADismissiveTextView *textView = [[MADismissiveTextView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 44)];
textView.dismissivePanGestureRecognizer = scrollView.panGestureRecognizer;
textView.keyboardDelegate = self;
[self.view addSubview:textView];
</pre>

h3. Dismissive Keyboard Delegate

The <code>MADismissiveKeyboardDelegate</code> protocol allows you to make changes to your UI at key moments during the animation of the <code>UIKeyboard</code>. These delegate methods are all optional.

<pre>
- (void)keyboardDidShow;
- (void)keyboardDidScroll:(CGPoint)keyboardOrigin;
- (void)keyboardWillGetDismissed;
- (void)keyboardWillSnapBack;
</pre>
